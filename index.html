            <h3>TAJMAHAL</h3>
            <img src="images/imag1.jpeg" width="490px" height="390px">

            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic
            architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave
            and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect.The Taj Mahal
            is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was
            commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his
            favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

                width="490px" height="390px">

            Qutb-Minar in red and buff standstone is the highest tower in India. It has a diameter of 14.32 m at the
            base and about 2.75 m on the top with a height of 72.5 m.Qutbu'd-Din Aibak laid the foundation of Minar in
            AD 1199 for the use of the mu'azzin (crier) to give calls for prayer and raised the first storey, to which
            were added three more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, Shamsu'd-Din Iltutmish (AD 1211-36). All the
            storeys are surrounded by a projected balcony encircling the minar and supported by stone brackets, which
            are decorated with honey-comb design, more conspicuously in the first storey.

            <h3>CHARMINAR</h3>
            <img src="images/img3.jpeg"
                width="490px" height="390px">

            Charminar is the most prominent landmark located right in the heart of Hyderabad. The monument was erected
            by Quli Qutub Shah to signify the founding of Hyderabad. As is evident from the structure, it was so named
            as it consists of four minarets. Although it lies right in the centre of the city with traffic and crowds
            milling all about it, Charminar certainly manages to hold the gaze. It is also famous for the market that
            sprawls around it and is called 'Laad' or 'Chudi' Bazaar.
            Since the construction of the monument in 1591, Charminar has been synonymous with the culture of Hyderabad
            standing tall as a reminder of the glorious days of the past era.

            <img src="images/img4.jpeg" width="490px" height="390px">

            India Gate, official name Delhi Memorial, originally called All-India War Memorial, monumental sandstone
            arch in New Delhi, dedicated to the troops of British India who died in wars fought between 1914 and 1919.
            India Gate, which is located at the eastern end of the Rajpath (formerly called the Kingsway), is about 138
            feet (42 metres) in height.At the centre of New Delhi stands the 42 m high India Gate, an “Arc-de-Triomphe”
            like archway in the middle of a crossroad. Almost similar to its French counterpart, it commemorates the
            70,000 Indian soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British Army during the World War I.

                width="490px" height="390px">

            The Gateway of India is one of India's most unique landmarks situated in the city of Mumbai. The colossal
            structure was constructed in 1924. Located at the tip of Apollo Bunder, the gateway overlooks the Mumbai
            harbor, bordered by the Arabian Sea in the Colaba district. The Gateway of India is a monument that marks
            India's chief ports and is a major tourist attraction for visitors who arrive in India for the first
            time.The main objective behind the construction of the Gateway of India was to commemorate the visit of King
            George V and Queen Mary to Bombay (Mumbai). In March 1911, Sir George Sydenham Clarke, who was then the
            Governor of Bombay, laid down the monument's first foundation.

            <h3>KONARK SUN TEMPLE</h3>
            <img src="images/img6.jpeg"
                width="490px" height="390px">

            The name Konark is made of two Sanskrit words: Kona, meaning corner, and arka, meaning sun. The town gets
            its name from its geographical location which makes it look like the sun rises at an angle.The history of
            Konark Sun Temple and sun worship goes as far back as the 19th century BC. The Konark Sun Temple, however,
            was built in the 13th century. The historic region of Kalinga which comprises major parts of modern-day
            Odisha and several parts of Chhatisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, was ruled by the rulers of the
            Eastern Ganga Dynasty from 5th Century AD to 15th Century AD. It was one of the most powerful dynasties in
            India which gave existence to majestic temples like Konark Sun Temple and Puri Jagannath Temple.
